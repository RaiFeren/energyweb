* The measurement devices cannot accept more than one connection
  at a time.
* All power readings are capped at 65.536 kW by the sensor devices

Local notes:
* NorthDorm2, WestDorm2, and EastDorm2 are all single phase, hence
  cwatthr is zero.  The others are three phase so we must consider
  cwatthr.
