energyweb is an energy usage monitoring/display system developed for
Harvey Mudd College, particularly for use during the November Energy
Competition.  It is not intended to be a general-purpose system, but
it will hopefully be found useful (and there are plans to use these
ideas as a starting point for a general-purpose utility monitoring
system).

External Requirements: recent Python (not 3.x), 
                       PostgreSQL (tested on 8.4), psycopg2,
                       webpy (tested on 0.34)

Power monitoring devices developed by Joseph King in the Engineering
Department are installed around campus.  These are cheap to make, thus
providing an attractive alternative to many energy monitoring solutions 
today.

Each device listens on a TCP port.  It can accept only one client.
When it has a client, it sends 45 bytes of energy data about once 
every 10 seconds.

The system presently consists of two basic parts:
 1. The energy monitor in bin/energymon.  This is a daemon that expects
    the id number of a sensor (on the command line) and loops on that
    sensor, collecting data and storing it in an SQL database.
 2. The web interface in web/ (with supporting files in www/, the
    web server's presumed document root).  This presents a graph of
    real-time power usage and a table of summary averages.  It runs on 
    web.py due to its minimal requirements of the web interface.  The
    graph is generated in JavaScript using jQuery and flot (included).
