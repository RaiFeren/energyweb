* Ensure .js is recognized as javascript, and served as such, 
  by the webserver.
* Set PYTHONPATH=/var/local/energy/lib so that energyconfig.py
  can be seen.
* Check lib/energyconfig.py, make sure everything looks sensible.
* The measurement devices cannot accept more than one connection
  at a time.
* NorthDorm2, WestDorm2, and EastDorm2 are all single phase, hence
  cwatthr is zero.  The others are three phase so we must consider
  cwatthr.
