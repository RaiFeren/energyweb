Purpose:
------
    For monitoring the energy usage of the various buildings on Harvey
    Mudd College. This system creates a website on which users can
    view a graph that displays the readings from the energy
    monitors. Graphs can be either updating in real time but
    constrained time periods, or user specified static graphs.
