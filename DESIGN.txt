==========

Purpose:
------
    For monitoring the energy usage of the various buildings on Harvey
    Mudd College. This system creates a website on which users can
    view a graph that displays the readings from the energy
    monitors. Graphs can be either updating in real time but
    constrained time periods, or user specified static graphs.

Limitations: 
---------
    Django requires a pre-Python 3.x installation
    Devices send data every 10 seconds, thus all computation must be faster than 10 seconds.
    Devices can not accept more than one connection at a time.


Possible Improvements:
------------------
- Watch the data coming in and figure out if a sensor has gone crazy/offline
- Re-design the website with all features in mind to create a efficient user experience
- Update some of the software packages used (e.g. Python 2.6 change to Python 2.7)
- Automate data backup
- Make the code easier to expand to more sensors
- Rework the download script
