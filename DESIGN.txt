==========

Purpose:
------
    For monitoring the energy usage of the various buildings on Harvey
    Mudd College. This system creates a website on which users can
    view a graph that displays the readings from the energy
    monitors. Graphs can be either updating in real time but
    constrained time periods, or user specified static graphs.

HOW TO USE
==========

How to use git:
----------
    Work is hosted on github. This allows for open source
    collaboration.

    Follow git's documentation for forking the project and installing
    git if necessary. The following will assume you already have a
    copy cloned to your computer.

    If a file has been added or changed, execute the following
    commands

        git add <FILENAME>
            Yes, use add EVEN when changing or deleting a file. This
            adds it to the list of things to be committed.
        git commit
            This will open up your default editor. Place a Subject
            line on the first line, then have a blank line, then
            whatever your update message is.
            This command seems to exist mostly to set the commit
            message.
        git push
            This command actually sends it to the git server.

    If a file has been changed on git, execute the following command
    
        git pull

How to Run:
---------
    First off, make sure you are logged into the server as energy.
    May need to execute
        sudo su - energy

    Once you're in...

    ./dev.sh init 
        Puts the server in a development environment. Will create a
        database with "development-friendly data"
    ./dev.sh start
        Starts all monitors
    ./dev.sh stop
        Stops all monitors
    ./dev.sh restart
        Restarts all monitors

    If the monitors stop working, do hard resets, then ssh in and
    ./dev restart

    manage.py is for interacting with the Django framework. As you
    might notice by looking at dev.sh, dev.sh simply calls manage.py
    with various arguments. Look up Django to see how manage.py
    works...

    ./backup.sh
        Will backup the PostgreSQL database on the machine. 
        Then saves the data in the format
        energy.TIME.sql.gz where TIME is
            4 digits for year
            2 digits for month
            2 digits for day
            2 digits for minute
            2 digits for hour

STRUCTURE
==========

    -----
    Files:        
    -----

        .gitignore - Lists the regexps for file names to ignore when
            committing to git.

        DESIGN.txt - You're reading it right now.
        LICENSE.txt - Code License
        README.rst - Readme file. Format is such that git can parse it.

        copy_to_django.sql - Apparently exists to transition from an
            older version of energyweb to the Django database. Unsure
            if it still has any purposeful functionality.
        backup.sh - Script for backing up the server.
        dev.sh - Script for managing the server. Able to start, stop,
            and restart the monitors. Also can boot into testing mode.
        initial_data.json - Associates Dorms with colors, as well as
            identifying which sensors are with which dorms, what IP
            addresses each sensor has, and what the multiplicative
            factor is.

        --- The following files are created by Django ---

    ---------------
    Data Structures: 
    ---------------

        The system has three essential layers
            Model - the PostgreSQL database
            Template - HTML, CSS, and Javascript for rendering the
                website
            Views - the Django that handles the interaction between
                the Models and Template.

        ----

        Templates are broken up into two components:

                the base in templates/base.html

                the contents within the five files in the
                    templates/graph folders. 

        ----

        Views are managed in graph/views.py

==========
LIMITATIONS
==========

    Inherent in System:
    ----
        Django requires a pre-Python 3.x installation.
        Devices send data every 10 seconds, thus all computation must
            be faster than 10 seconds.
        Devices can not accept more than one connection at a time.
        There is a large amount of data, such that backing it up takes
            30 minutes and consumes the CPU and Memory for that time.

    Revisable:
    ----
        To download graph data from the web, user must input
            timestamps and desired resolution by hand.
        When downloading the data, json format is not human readable.
        Data is currently only stored on the server itself without backups.
        System is unable to recognize when a sensor is down, causing
            delays in troubleshooting

==========
POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS
==========

    Update software packages used (e.g. Python 2.6 change
        to Python 2.7) 
    Make the code more modular for expand to more sensors 

    Re-design the website with all features in mind to create a
        efficient user experience 
    Rework the download data script 

    Watch the data coming in and figure out if a sensor has gone
        crazy/offline then send notification in some way.
    Automate data backup
    Rework on ways to backup data
