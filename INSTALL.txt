PACKAGES DOWNLOADED AND INSTALLED
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To install via Ubuntu's package manager, type at the command line
   sudo apt-get install PACKAGE_NAME

apache2
    - Priority: HIGH - You need this to run a server.
    - Finding it: Should be automatically found and installed during
                        Ubuntu Server installation.
    - Installation: See above. Read SETUP.txt for setup instructions.
    - Dependencies: Ubuntu.
**********
apache2-dev
    - Priority: HIGH - apache2-mod-wsgi needs this to work.
    - Finding it: Use apt-get to retrieve and install.
    - Installation: See above.
    - Dependencies: Apache2
**********
apache2-mod-wsgi
    - Priority: HIGH - You need this to get django and Apache to interact.
    - Finding it: We used apt-get to retrieve and install, but had to add a 
                        mirror to the debian files.
    - Installation: See above. Additionally, this installation put Python 2.6
                          onto the server, but did not overwrite Python 2.7 as our
                          preferred Python.
    - Dependencies: Apache2, apache2-dev
**********
django
    - Priority: HIGH - This is the frame of your web server.
    - Finding it: Use lynx to find on the internet.
    - Installation: Follow instructions on website. Do not try to configure
                           until you have installed everything else you plan on 
                           using for your web server (PostgreSQL, psycopg2...)
    - Dependencies: Python, Ubuntu, lynx(optional)
**********
emacs
    - Priority: Low - This is a nice text editor to have that isn't nano.
    - Finding it: Use apt-get to retrieve and install.
    - Installation: See above.
    - Dependencies: Ubuntu
**********
htop
    - Priority: Medium - It's a nice utility that lets you see the breakdown of
                    what processes are using what resources, but not
                    necessary for functionality.
    - Finding it: Use apt-get to retrieve and install.
    - Installation: See above.
    - Dependencies: Ubuntu
**********
libpq-dev
    - Priority: High - psycopg2 requires this python module.
    - Finding it: Use apt-get to retrieve and install.
    - Installation: See above.
    - Dependencies: Python
**********
lynx
    - Priority: Low - Lets you browse the web and download packages, but
                    probably an unnecessary utility.
    - Finding it: Use apt-get to retrieve and install.
    - Installation: See above.
    - Dependencies: Ubuntu
**********
PostgreSQL
    - Priority: HIGH - You need this to have a database.
    - Finding it: You should be given an optional install message when
                         installing Ubuntu Server.
    - Installation: Despite what Ubuntu says, you will have to install this
                           later on its own.
    - Dependencies: Ubuntu
**********
psycopg2
    - Priority: High - creates an interface between PostgreSQL and Python.
    - Finding it: You can use lynx to download it off the internet.
    - Installation: Follow instructions given by the site where you found the
                           package.
    - Dependencies: Python, python-dev, libpq-dev, lynx(optional)
**********
Python 2.7
    - Priority: HIGH - most of the code for the server is in Python.
    - Finding it: No need.
    - Installation: Auto-installs during ubuntu installation.
    - Dependencies: Ubuntu Server
**********
python-dev
    - Priority: High - psycopg2 requires this python module.

Ubuntu Server 11.04, 64-bit

                    impossible to find using a non-Linux operating system.
    - Finding it: On a different machine downloaded from the internet, 
       then transferred to server on a cd.
    - Installation: Will give you options to install some other packages.
    - Dependencies: A computer.
