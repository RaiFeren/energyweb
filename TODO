* Figure out how to properly start at boot, stop at shutdown.
  (Try for an init script using pkill -x, perhaps?  Or make the
  subprocess daemonic...)
* Can the devices accept more than one connection at a time? (NO)
* Is the stats/graph behavior correct?  (The Rhizome routines,
  which I tried to reproduce, seems inconsistent.)
* What about those occasional huge spikes?  (Typically North HVAC.)
* Accidentally logging all inputs at the debug level.  This is okay for the time being---actually it might help with the North HVAC issue---but we'll want to restart the monitor at some point so that we stop wasting so much space w logs.  We could do this by writing a script to stop the monitor, clear the logs, and restart the monitor, and we could time execution of this script so that it runs within the 10-second interval between updates.  Perhaps we should also set up another script that polls for a connection to the sensors, in hopes of catching any data that might try to escape.
* Change color scheme:  make north 1, north 2, north hvac solid, dashed, dotted of all the same color.  Similar for West and East.
* Get DNS record, set up web server with the name, get another record, set up git or something with that... or maybe a sub-sub-domain?
* Scale the graph so it's optimal on the TV.  Then implement multiple scales, or perhaps automatic scaling to the window.
* Change the page title.
