<p>
    The raw data is available in a JSON format.  It can be retrieved at the URL
    {{ interface_url_template }} where {{ interface_start_placeholder }} and
    {{ interface_end_placeholder }} are UTC timestamps (seconds since the
    epoch) indicating your desired date range and 
    {{ interface_res_placeholder }} is the resolution of the data.  Valid
    options for the resolution are:
    <ul>
        {% for res_choice in res_choices %}
            <li>{{ res_choice.0 }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    If you choose automatic resolution, the resolution will be chosen for you
    based on the size of your date range.
</p>
<p>
    You may desire to retrieve data at a specific URL more than once in a
    session.  If this is the case, be careful to avoid any client-side caches.
    Appending something like {{ interface_junk_suffix }} to the URL, where
    {{ interface_junk_placeholder }} is randomly generated, may accomplish
    this.
</p>
<p>
    The JSON data is a hashmap (associative array, dictionary) whose keys and
    values are as follows.
    <ul>
        <li>no_results: 
            A boolean indicating whether any results have been found.  If this
            is false, there are no readings in the specified date range, or the
            resolution may be too coarse.
        </li>
        <li>sensor_groups:
            A list representing the sensors and sensor groups.  (See below for
            an explanation of these and a description of the structure of this
            list.)
        </li>
        <li>show_points:  (Not present when no_results is true.)
            A boolean used in the web-based graph to determine whether to show
            individual points or just the lines connecting them.  This is
            probably not important to you unless you want to display a graph
            of similar scale and don't want to decide yourself whether there
            are too many points to show.
        </li>
        <li>sg_xy_pairs:  (Not present when no_results is true.)
            A hashmap (associative array, dictionary) representing the data.
            Its structure is explained below.
        </li>
    </ul>
    For each Rhizome device reporting power data to the system, there is a
    "sensor" in the database.  At Mudd, some dorms have multiple sensors, so
    sensors are grouped (into aptly-named "sensor groups") by dorm.  Each
    sensor group is represented in sensor_groups as a list whose elements
    are as follows.
    <ol>
        <li>The unique ID of the sensor group (an integer).</li>
        <li>The name of the sensor group, i.e. the name of the dorm 
            (a string).</li>
        <li>The color corresponding to the sensor group in the web-based graph
            (a six-character string indicating the hexadecimal RGB code).</li>
        <li>A list of sensors belonging to this sensor group.  (Each sensor is
            represented, in turn, as a two-element list:  The unique sensor ID,
            an integer, and the name of the sensor, a string.)</li>
    </ol>
    The hashmap (associative array, dictionary) sg_xy_pairs has keys equal to
    the sensor group IDs (encoded as strings).  The value for a given sensor
    group is a list of lists, each of which has two elements:  A UTC
    timestamp in milliseconds representing the time of a power reading, and 
    the power reading itself (in kilowatts, as a floating-point number).
</p>
<p>
Note that power readings are collected every 10 seconds.  When you request data
using this interface, however, you retrieve averages.  For example, using the
per-week resolution, the data returned will be per-week averages indexed by the
start date of each week.  This holds true even for per-ten-second resolution.
(The data is easier to work with this way, since some ten-second intervals may
have no points while some could potentially have two points.)
